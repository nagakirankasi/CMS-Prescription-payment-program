# Prescription Payment Program (PPP)

## Project Overview
The **Prescription Payment Program (PPP)** is a federal government-mandated initiative by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). It ensures that health plans provide real-time prescription cost-sharing information to beneficiaries at the point of sale. This project demonstrates the implementation of the program for a health plan, ensuring CMS compliance and seamless integration with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).

## Project Goals
- Enable real-time prescription cost transparency.
- Integrate with CMS endpoints and PBM platform.
- Ensure HIPAA and CMS compliance for secure data exchange.
- Automate data reporting and error tracking.

## Solution Architecture 
As an IT Architect, I led the end-to-end solution design and implementation:
Note - This is an option I would recommend to implement this program.

![Solution Design Approach](docs/Solution Design)

- **Architecture:** Event-driven microservices
- **Cloud:** AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, SNS/SQS)
- **API:** RESTful endpoints with Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform and AWS CDK
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- **Security:** OAuth2.0, JWT, and CMS-compliant encryption

## Key Features
1. **Real-Time Cost Sharing:** APIs to calculate and share prescription costs instantly.
2. **PBM Integration:** Seamless data exchange with third-party PBMs.
3. **Automated Reporting:** Scheduled jobs for CMS compliance reporting.
4. **Monitoring & Alerts:** CloudWatch-based health checks.
5. **Error Handling:** Robust retry mechanisms using AWS SQS.

## Deployment
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Prescription-Payment-Program-CMS.git
```
2. Set up AWS credentials.
3. Deploy infrastructure using Terraform:
```bash
cd deployment
terraform init
terraform apply
```
4. Deploy APIs and Lambda functions:
```bash
cd src
npm install
npm run deploy
```

## Project Outcomes
- Achieved CMS compliance by [Go-Live Date].
- Reduced prescription cost-sharing errors by **30%**.
- Streamlined PBM integration with real-time tracking.
- Successfully processed **500,000+ transactions** monthly.
