# Solution Design Document for Prescription Payment Program (PPP)

## 1. Project Overview
The Prescription Payment Program (PPP) is a CMS-mandated initiative aimed at providing real-time prescription cost-sharing information to beneficiaries. This project implements the solution for a health plan to comply with federal requirements while ensuring secure, efficient, and scalable operations.

## 2. Solution Architecture
The solution follows a microservices-based architecture using AWS services for compute, storage, and API management. Key components include:

- **API Gateway:** Manages external API requests securely.
- **Lambda:** Executes business logic for prescription processing.
- **DynamoDB:** Stores prescription cost-sharing information.
- **S3 Bucket:** Stores prescription-related documents.
- **SNS:** Sends notifications for processing outcomes.
- **CloudWatch:** Monitors system performance and logs errors.

## 3. High-Level Design

### 3.1 Data Flow
1. **User Request:** Beneficiary or pharmacy submits a request for cost-sharing details via the API Gateway.
2. **Lambda Processing:** API Gateway triggers a Lambda function to process the request.
3. **Data Retrieval:** Lambda retrieves prescription details from DynamoDB.
4. **Response:** Lambda returns cost-sharing details to the requester.
5. **Notification:** SNS sends alerts for failed or completed transactions.

### 3.2 API Endpoints
- `POST /prescription/cost` - Calculate prescription cost.
- `GET /prescription/{id}` - Retrieve prescription details.
- `PUT /prescription/{id}` - Update prescription record.

### 3.3 Database Design
- **DynamoDB Table:** `PrescriptionPaymentTable`
  - `PrescriptionID` (Primary Key)
  - `BeneficiaryID`
  - `DrugCode`
  - `CostSharingAmount`
  - `Status`

## 4. Infrastructure Design
### AWS Resources
- **S3:** `prescription-payment-program-data`
- **DynamoDB:** `PrescriptionPaymentTable`
- **Lambda:** `PrescriptionPaymentHandler`
- **API Gateway:** `PrescriptionPaymentAPI`
- **SNS:** `prescription-payment-notifications`
- **CloudWatch:** `/aws/lambda/PrescriptionPaymentHandler`

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Terraform templates manage the provisioning of AWS resources. The `main.tf` file defines resources, while `variables.tf` and `outputs.tf` streamline deployment.

## 5. Security and Compliance
- **Authentication:** OAuth2.0 with JWT tokens.
- **Encryption:** AWS-managed encryption for S3 and DynamoDB.
- **IAM Roles:** Fine-grained access controls for Lambda and API Gateway.
- **HIPAA Compliance:** Data-at-rest and in-transit encryption.

## 6. Monitoring and Logging
- **CloudWatch Logs:** Monitors Lambda execution.
- **CloudWatch Alarms:** Alerts for failed API requests.
- **X-Ray:** Traces API request flows for debugging.

## 7. Deployment and CI/CD
- **Pipeline:** GitHub Actions for automated build, test, and deployment.
- **Stages:**
  - **Build:** Validate code and dependencies.
  - **Test:** Run unit and integration tests.
  - **Deploy:** Provision AWS infrastructure and deploy Lambda functions.

## 8. Error Handling and Notifications
- **Retry Mechanism:** SQS queues for failed requests.
- **SNS Alerts:** Notification for failed transactions and system outages.

## 9. Success Metrics
- **Performance:** API response time under 500 ms.
- **Scalability:** Supports 1,000+ concurrent requests.
- **Error Rate:** Less than 1% of requests fail.

## 10. Conclusion
This solution ensures CMS compliance, enhances beneficiary experience, and provides a scalable and secure architecture for prescription cost-sharing operations.
